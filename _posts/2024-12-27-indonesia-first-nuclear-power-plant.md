Indonesia's first nuclear power plant will be built on Kelasa Island in Bangka Belitung with PT Thorcon Indonesia as the investor.

A prototype reactor, to be delivered from South Korea in 2028, will be part of a Rp17 trillion (US$1.06 billion) investment covering surveys, research, technology transfer, and infrastructure. 

This project is expected to enhance renewable energy development and increase investor confidence. Potential locations include Tanjung Ular in West Bangka and some areas in South Bangka. 

PT Thorcon Indonesia is awaiting approval for the regional spatial planning regulation.
